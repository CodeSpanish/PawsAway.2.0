# Greyhounds as Pets: What You Need to Know

Greyhounds are known for their speed, grace, and agility on the racetrack. However, these dogs make wonderful pets too. Greyhounds are loyal, affectionate, and gentle, making them ideal for families, singles, and seniors.

We had our first experience with greyhounds many years ago after we lost a young German shepherd to cancer. We weren’t ready to commit to another dog, so we started fostering through several organisations instead. That is how we came across Greyhounds as Pets (GAP), a registered charity initially established by Greyhound Racing New Zealand (GRNZ). Their purpose is to find caring homes for greyhounds leaving the racing industry. And that is how we met Luka, a loopy but very friendly, handsome greyhound who has lived with us for many years. You can see him on the right in the picture.

Greyhounds are fantastic family pets, but like anything in life, it comes down to what you want in a dog. The following content reflects our experience and that of the foster parents and breeders community.

## Temperament

Greyhounds have a gentle and calm temperament. They are affectionate, loyal, and intelligent dogs but can be reserved around strangers. They love to be close to their humans and are often called “velcro dogs” because they stick close to their owners. This makes them great companions for people looking for a dog who will always be beside them. Take the latter with a pinch of salt.

They are loyal and gentle, but their recall tends to be abysmal. Our Luka is a “leaner”. He loves leaning on us and the people we meet. But when you let him loose for a run, forget of him coming back when you call him. We trained him when he joined us, and he was better for many years, but in his older years, he is reverting to his old habits. We noted this is common with many greyhounds that stay boarding with us.

Think about it. Racing dogs are not the smartest and are not trained for work. They were trained to walk on the lead to the racing track, but it is all about running and nothing else when off the leash.

## Children

Greyhounds can make great family pets, but it’s important to supervise them around young children. Greyhounds are generally patient and gentle with children, but their large and fast movements can intimidate small children. Therefore, teaching children how to interact with dogs respectfully and safely is essential. Children should also be taught not to pull on a greyhound’s tail or ears and to give the dog space when eating or sleeping.

Keep in mind that greyhounds are medium to large dogs. So, their mouth is at the eye level of children. So, while greyhounds are very calm, they are still dogs and will react if they feel threatened or pain is inflicted on them. We’ve never had an incident with Luka, but we had one with another greyhound, and it was because he had a severe injury, and we tried to help him.

# Exercise

Contrary to popular belief, Greyhounds do not require a lot of exercise. While they enjoy a good run, they are often called “couch potatoes” and are perfectly content to lounge around the house with their humans. Compared to other breeds, they will sleep all day if you let them and won’t bother going out, but that is unhealthy. They need daily exercise like any of us, so taking them for regular walks is essential. This is a generalisation and probably will depend on their routine as puppies. We had some greyhounds pacing around the house because they wanted to go for a walk, but they were the minority.

They also enjoy interactive playtime with their owners and other dogs, such as playing fetch or chasing a toy. How greyhounds play, mainly how retired dogs do it, is an interesting topic. Luka likes playing, but playing with other dogs or us is odd. It is more like running without any connection to the game we are playing, and he doesn’t understand what fetch is. We tried to teach him to fetch but without luck.

# Living Arrangements

Greyhounds can make great apartment dogs because they are quiet and calm indoors. However, they need daily exercise, so taking them for regular walks is important. It’s also important to note that some greyhounds may be uncomfortable in a smaller living space and prefer a home with a yard. Therefore, when considering adopting a greyhound, it’s important to consider your living arrangements and ensure you can provide them with the exercise and space they need.

When you bring a retired racing dog home, it’s essential to be patient and give them time to adjust to their new surroundings. Greyhounds are often shy and nervous initially, so being gentle and calm with them is important. Provide them with plenty of love and attention, but also give them space when they need it. It may take some time for your greyhound to bond with you, but with patience and care, they will become a loyal and devoted companion.

It takes a lot to hear a greyhound bark. They are not guard dogs, so at best, they raise their ears or stand up to look at what’s going on. Our Luka only barks when he is playing and getting excited or demands food. But their bark is pathetic. So it is unlikely your neighbour will complain about it.

# Grooming

Greyhounds have short, smooth coats that do not shed excessively. Therefore, they require minimal grooming, which makes them low-maintenance pets. However, they shed seasonally and may need more brushing during those times. They also require regular nail trims and dental care like any other pet.

One of the few negatives of greyhounds is their poor oral health. So, dental care is a thing with greyhounds. Most require a range of tools and techniques to maintain their teeth, and many need regular cleaning under anaesthetic. [This article from GAP](https://greyhoundsaspets.org.nz/blog/greyhound-health-oral-care) is an excellent place to start for some tips on this matter.

# Other Pets

Greyhounds can coexist with other pets, but it’s important to socialise them properly. Some Greyhounds have a high prey drive and may chase small animals, so it’s important to supervise them around smaller pets. Introducing them to other pets gradually and under controlled circumstances is also important. With proper socialisation, many Greyhounds can live peacefully with other pets.

Because of their drive to chase prey, it is vital to test if they are cat friendly. Most organisations rehoming greyhounds do that before adopting them out, and if a dog is not friendly to cats won’t adopt them out to a cat household. Don’t underestimate this fact. They are killing machines when it comes to small animals. We met irresponsible owners that had adopted a non-cat-friendly greyhound when they had cats, which ended in tragedy. While a greyhound won’t stand a chance fighting with many other dog breeds, when it comes to cats, it is a different story.

# Health

Greyhounds are generally healthy dogs but prone to certain medical conditions, such as hip dysplasia, bloat, and osteosarcoma. It’s important to be aware of these issues and take steps to prevent them. Regular vet checkups and proper nutrition can help keep your greyhound healthy and happy.

Keep in mind that greyhounds are not built like your average dog. You cannot play rough with them. Their bodies are designed to run, so while they are very athletic, their bodies are very rigid. They will complain immediately if you try to tumble and rumble with a greyhound. Their rigidity also makes it hard for retired dogs to sit; their large thigh and quads impede them from doing it comfortably, and in many cases, when they sit, their bottom never touches the ground. So, be gentle with them to avoid sprained muscles or worse.

Finally, as we mentioned, they have poor oral hygiene compared to other breeds. As a result, their breath will often be foul, and you need to keep up with brushing their teeth.

# Accessories and supplies

Like any adopted dog, preparing your home and ensuring a safe and comfortable environment for your new pet is important. This includes creating a designated area for your greyhound to sleep, eat, and play. You should also purchase any necessary supplies, such as food and water bowls, a leash and collar, and a comfortable bed. However, while you can buy regular pet accessories, greyhounds are built differently than other breeds, so there are supplies explicitly designed for them.

For example, greyhounds are very skinny and suffer from the cold, so purchasing a comfy bed and a warm coat is a good investment. However, you will find that your new friend will stubbornly sleep on the sofa if you don’t put boundaries. Luka is stubborn in this matter, he doesn’t jump on the couch when we are around, but he sneaks into it the moment we leave the house or go to bed at night. So we cover our sofa with uncomfortable items if we are going to sleep or leave the house.

Greyhound collars are a special topic. Because of their head and jaw size and shape, your average collar is not the best option. They easily slide off. So, martingale collars are commonly used with greyhounds. A martingale is a collar designed to prevent a dog from slipping out of it. Unlike traditional collars that must be buckled uncomfortably tight to prevent escape, these collars are comfortable around the neck until engaged.

## Adopting a greyhound – conclusion

Greyhounds make excellent pets for people of all ages and lifestyles. They are gentle, affectionate, and loyal dogs that love to be close to their humans. While they may have a few quirks and require special care, they are generally low-maintenance pets well-suited for apartment living and small spaces. With proper care and attention, your greyhound will become a beloved family member for years.

Finding a reputable organisation is crucial if you are considering adopting a retired racing dog. They can help you find a dog that matches your lifestyle and provide the support and resources you need to care for your new pet. We adopted Luka through [GAP](https://greyhoundsaspets.org.nz/) in New Zealand, and they’ve been a great help. There are similar organisations around the world, such as [Greyhound Trust UK](https://greyhoundsaspets.org.nz/) , [Greyhound GAP UK](https://www.greyhoundgap.org.uk/) and [Grey2K USA](https://www.grey2kusa.org/action/adopt.php).
