# Flying with a Dog in the Cabin - Must-Knows

Flying with a dog in the cabin can be an exciting experience, but it requires careful planning, and there are several things to consider to ensure a safe and comfortable journey. This post will cover everything you need to know about flying with a dog.

In most cases, you can take small dogs in the cabin of a plane. However, it’s important to note that the specific rules and regulations around flying with dogs can vary depending on the airline and your destination. Some airlines may not allow dogs in the cabin at all or may only allow certain types of pets or breeds. It’s essential to check with your airline well before your trip to ensure that your dog meets all the requirements for flying in the cabin.

Assuming your dog can fly in the cabin, you can take several steps to ensure the journey is safe and comfortable for you and your furry friend. Some tips to keep in mind include the following:

## Know the Airline’s Pet Policy

Before booking your flight, checking your airline’s pet policy is essential. Policies and fees may vary depending on the airline, so read all the requirements carefully. For example, **some airlines allow dogs in the cabin, while others only permit them to travel in cargo**. Generally, smaller dogs that can fit in a carrier under the seat in front of you are allowed in the cabin. You may also need to provide a health certificate or other documentation for your dog.

These airlines allow dogs on some of their flights:

- United States:

  - [Delta Airlines](https://www.delta.com/us/en/pet-travel/overview)

  - [JetBlue](https://www.jetblue.com/traveling-together/traveling-with-pets)

## Flying with a large dog

While most commercial airlines don’t allow it, **flying with a large dog in the cabin is possible on charter flights**. Be aware that many online sources wrongly list airlines as allowing medium-to-large dogs because they do not specify a weight limit. However, the size of the carriers permitted and where the carrier must be located (often at your feet) indicate that medium-to-large dogs are not allowed in the cabin.

Even those companies that allow larger dogs may have breed restrictions or only allow large dogs if they are trained service dogs. So it’s important to check with your airline before your trip to ensure your dog meets all the requirements and will be comfortable.

It is also important to consider the comfort and safety of your dog during the flight. Large dogs may need extra space and ventilation during the flight and may also require more frequent bathroom breaks. It’s essential to plan accordingly and bring any necessary supplies, such as a water bowl, waste bags, and a leash.

Charter flights are more expensive, and, in most cases, an extra chair must be purchased for your dog. However, if you have to travel with your pet, you are not comfortable travelling with your dog in the cargo, or your [dog suffers from anxiety](blog/6-tips-to-help-a-dog-with-kennel-anxiety), a charter flight may be the best option available.

## Choose the Right Dog Carrier

Flying with small dogs is more straightforward than with large breeds. However, a good dog carrier is crucial for your dog’s comfort and safety during air travel. Remember that airlines have specific guidelines for pet carriers, so it’s important to check with your airline to ensure you purchase the right size carrier for your dog.

**When choosing a carrier, you must consider two types: soft-sided and hard-sided**. A soft-sided carrier is usually the best choice for cabin travel, as it can easily be placed under the seat. On the other hand, hard-sided carriers offer better protection but may be less comfortable and heavier. Whatever type you choose, make sure that it is easy to clean and sanitize in case of accidents during the flight.

A final aspect to consider is airflow. Choose a dog carrier with good ventilation to prevent your dog from overheating and feeling anxious during the flight. Look for carriers with plenty of ventilation holes or mesh windows.

## Prepare Your Dog for Air Travel

Air travel with dogs can be a stressful experience for both you and your furry friend. However, with the proper preparation, you can ensure a safe and comfortable trip for your dog.

**The first step in preparing for air travel with your dog is to make sure they are up-to-date on their vaccinations** and have the required health certificates from your veterinarian. So, check with plenty of time to avoid any last-minute surprises.

To make your dog comfortable, practice with the carrier several weeks before the flight by letting them sleep or eat inside it at home. This will allow your dog to get accustomed to being in the carrier for extended periods and help them feel more comfortable and less anxious during the flight.

Exercising your dog before the flight is also recommended to help them relax and sleep during the journey. On the day of the flight, ensure your dog has exercised and used the bathroom before heading to the airport.

During the flight, talk to your dog in a soothing voice, and provide them plenty of water and small amounts of food to keep them comfortable. Avoid giving your dog any sedatives or medication unless prescribed by a veterinarian. Instead, bring your dog’s favourite toys and treats to keep them calm and entertained during the flight.

After the flight, give your dog time to recover and adjust to its new surroundings. Provide them with plenty of water, food, and a comfortable resting place.

## Pack for Your Dog

Pack everything your dog needs for the flight in your carry-on bag or the dog carrier. Firstly, check with your airline and veterinarian for any specific requirements or recommendations for packing. Moreover, it’s important to remember that some airlines restrict the types of food and treats you can bring for your dog. Nevertheless, these are some key things to remember:

**The first thing you should pack is their identification and all necessary travel documents**, such as health certificates and vaccination records. In addition, include any medications your dog needs and a first aid kit in case of emergencies. It is also advisable to have a recent photo of your dog in case they get lost during the trip.

Bring enough food and treats for your dog for the journey, along with feeding bowls or containers. Also, pack enough water and a water bowl to keep your dog hydrated during the flight.

Pack a blanket or towel for your dog to lie on and their favourite toys or comfort items to keep them calm and entertained during the flight.

Finally, pack a leash, a collar and waste bags for bathroom breaks. It’s crucial to keep your dog leashed and under control at all times during the trip.

## Arrive Early and Communicate with Airline Staff

When flying with a dog, arriving at the airport early and communicating with airline staff is important. Before booking your flight, informing the airline of your dog’s size and breed is a good idea. This will help the airline determine if there are any specific restrictions or requirements that you need to be aware of.

**Arrive early to give you plenty of time to check in and go through security** without feeling rushed or stressed. It also gives you time to make last-minute adjustments or accommodations for your dog, such as exercising them, finding a quiet area to rest, or a last toilet stop before the flight. If you’re travelling with a large dog, be prepared for additional screening and security measures. For example, you may need to have your dog walk through a metal detector or be inspected by a security officer.

Ensure you check in with the airline staff to confirm that your dog is checked in and their carrier meets all guidelines. When about to board, **let the flight attendants know that you have a dog and that they are aware of any special needs or instructions**. Be clear and concise about your dog’s needs and any special accommodations they may require. For example, if your dog is anxious or easily stressed, let the airline staff know so they can make arrangements to keep your dog calm during the flight.

In conclusion, flying with a dog requires careful preparation and planning. These tips and guidelines can help ensure your dog has a safe and comfortable journey. Remember to check your airline’s pet policy, choose a suitable dog carrier, prepare your dog for travel, pack for your dog, and communicate with airline staff. You and your furry friend can enjoy a stress-free and memorable air travel experience with the proper preparation and care.
