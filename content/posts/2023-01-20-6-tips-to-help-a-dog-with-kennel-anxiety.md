# 6 tips to help a dog with kennel anxiety

Seeing your dog show anxiety and stress toward the kennel can be heartbreaking. It is common to happen when you board your pet for the first time. When it happens repeatedly, you may want to consider taking action sooner rather than later.

**If your dog suffers from kennel anxiety, rule out any medical issues. Next, consider crate training and exercising your dog before kennel boarding. Also, provide them with a chew toy and anything containing your scent in their crate. Lastly, if you plan on leaving your dog with someone else, ensure they are trustworthy.**

## 1. Rule Out Medical Problems

If your dog has recurring kennel anxiety, take them to the vet so they can be checked out for health problems. Physical illnesses, such as urinary tract infections and an upset stomach, exacerbate stress and anxiety among dogs. Similarly, dogs with phobias, hyper attachment disorder, and separation anxiety may find pet boarding particularly challenging.

Addressing these health issues is critical in helping a dog with kennel anxiety. In addition, your vet will be able to prescribe the proper treatment for separation anxiety, like over-the-counter calming supplements, based on this information.

## 2. Do Proper Crate Training

Dogs should recognize their crate as a safe place by fostering positive experiences. Since they won’t perceive the crate negatively, getting used to a kennel will be easier. Their crates should be introduced once they get home with you. Also, crate training should follow a consistent schedule and be part of their routine.

If your dog is older and has not undergone any training, it’s still possible for them to get used to an anti-anxiety dog crate. However, expect that you’ll need more time to do this compared to when training a puppy.

## 3. Get Your Dog Some Exercise

Before boarding your dogs at a kennel, take them for a walk or play on the field. Making them [exercise before leaving](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631323/#:~:text=Our%20study%20highlights%20the%20importance%20of%20early%20life%20experiences%2C%20especially%20the%20quality%20of%20maternal%20care%20and%20daily%20exercise%20for%20the%20welfare%20and%20management%20of%20the%20dogs%2C%20and%20reveals%20important%20confounding%20factors%20to%20be%20considered%20in%20the%20genetic%20characterization%20of%20canine%20anxiety) allows them to use much of their energy. So, once they are in the kennel, their body will choose to rest, helping relieve their dog’s kennel anxiety.

## 4. Get Your Dog an Interactive Toy

Pet toys can become effective distractions for dogs in the kennel as they provide mental stimulation. If you’re putting your canine in a crate, ensure it’s spacious enough to accommodate their toys.

Choose safe items for them to play with when left alone, like food-stuffed toys. Otherwise, instruct the kennel operator to watch your dog closely. But, to save you from the hassle, go for the first tip.

## 5. Make Use of an Item With a Familiar Smell

Leaving a used cloth, a shoe, a sock, or an old blanket for your dog is one of the most effective home remedies for separation anxiety in dogs. [Your dog finds comfort in anything that bears your scent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921663/#:~:text=This%20study%20demonstrated%20that%20the%20owner%27s%20odor%20or%20voice%20could%20reduce%20separation%20related%20stress%20significantly%20at%20the%20physiological%20level.). In a way, they are assured that you’re just nearby or will be around soon.

## 6. Consider Leaving Your Dog to Someone You Trust

If you’re going to be away for more than four hours straight or more, you may want to rethink leaving them on their own at home. Instead, consider doggy daycares. Or, if you will be gone for days, find a kennel or someone who can look after your dog with the same care you give – or more.

The ideal kennels for dogs with anxiety have caretakers who understand your dog’s emotions, know how to deal with behavioural issues, and provide all your dogs’ needs. If you find someone within these selection criteria, build a good relationship with them – so your dog does too.

## Dealing With Dog Kennel Anxiety as a Pet Owner/Fur Parent

How you respond to dogs with separation anxiety and your stance as the owner or pet parent impact the state of the condition. Keep in mind that you can develop a strong connection with your dog.

[A 2018 study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13420-018-0325-2#:~:text=Recent%20scientific%20literature%20shows%20that%20emotional%20cues%20conveyed%20by%20human%20vocalizations%20and%20odours%20are%20processed%20in%20an%20asymmetrical%20way%20by%20the%20canine%20brain.) revealed further that dogs could sense emotional cues. So, if you express negative feelings about leaving your dog in the kennel, your dog can pick it up and mirror the same emotions. Here are some additional tips when dealing with dog kennel anxiety.

### Set a healthy boundary

Hyperattached dogs or velcro dogs, if you may, are more likely to experience dog kennel anxiety and will have the least comfort when separated from their fur parents or attachment figures.

Although sometimes it may feel challenging not to spoil your adorable dog, it’s still best to establish a clear boundary through proper dog separation anxiety training. In addition, having a certain level of independence will make them more resilient to feeling lonely or bored.

### Leave and return in a subtle way

Don’t make leaving and returning a big deal for your dogs. Avoid showing sadness when you go or giving an exuberant greeting when coming back. Dogs who associate extreme emotions before and after your absence tend to develop separation anxiety more. So, remain calm yet assertive to prevent overexcitement or extreme sadness from your dog.

### Manage your guilt

It’s hard not to feel bad about putting your dog in a kennel, let alone a crate. However, hiding that guilt is important, especially for your pup’s benefit. Also, consider getting an anti-anxiety dog crate that will provide added comfort to your dog.

### Never punish your dog for having dog kennel anxiety

Showing anger, frustration, or worse, punishing your dog for having dog kennel anxiety is a huge mistake. It’s downright cruel and a huge red flag for pet owners or fur parents. Additionally, showing dominance and forcing your dogs to settle down will only aggravate their anxiety, affecting their overall health in the long term.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does my dog hate the kennel?

Dogs hating the kennel can be associated with a stressful or traumatic event in the past. For example, your dog may have been kept in the kennel for a long time and had developed separation anxiety, loneliness, or boredom. Or, it might have been used for punishment. In either case, your dog’s impression of the kennel will depend on whether or not they were properly trained and how the kennel is set up.

### What are the signs of kennel stress?

Your dog is likely going through kennel stress if they show the following signs and symptoms of separation anxiety.

- Pacing
- Fatigue
- Shaking
- Freezing
- Diarrhoea
- Vomiting
- Lip licking
- Lack of appetite
- Excessive barking

Observe if your dog has destructive behaviour when taken to the kennel. For example, some dogs will outright object and even refuse to move and get into the kennel. If this anxious behaviour is repeated in the kennel, investigate the environment closely. On the other hand, if it’s the first time your dog gets boarded, expect that there will be some level of stress. Hence, it’s best to leave your furry one to trustworthy caretakers.

### How can I calm my dog’s kennel anxiety?

Apart from the tips above, you can also ease your dog’s kennel anxiety by playing soothing music and establishing trust with the caretaker. Before boarding your pet, you should always check the kennel and talk to the owner. Ask your veterinarian to prescribe a calming medication if anxiety worsens.

## Takeaway

A certain stress level comes with pet boarding for the dog and its owner. The good news is that if you understand how to handle dog kennel anxiety, you can help your dog overcome its fear and reluctance to go to boarding – ultimately treating separation anxiety in dogs. Therefore, you’ll feel less worried and more confident about leaving your dog. Additionally, do not hesitate to speak with other people who care for your dogs, such as the vet and the kennel operator.
