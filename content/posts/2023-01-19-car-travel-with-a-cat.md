# Car Travel With a Cat – 10 Valuable Tips

Cats can be fun to travel with, but only if they’re well-prepared. Since most cats prefer to stay home, car rides may be stressful. But it is possible to turn the experience around if you know what to arrange before travelling.

**For car travel with a cat, train your feline buddy to take car rides and stay in a carrier. Get a spacious carrier with items that provide comfort for your cat. Prepare essential items like a travel litter box, food, water, and treats. Plan your stops on the road, and don’t forget to consult your cat’s vet before the trip.**

Learn more about these tips as you read on.

## Before travel

How successful travelling with your cat will be will depend on how well you plan your trip. Plan at least a couple of months earlier for long-distance road trips with your cat. Make sure you prepare your cat by providing the necessary training and securing items to keep them in the car.

### 1. Get your cat used to riding in the car

Your cat should be familiar with your car before you even begin to think of taking them on a road trip. However, it should not end with that. Cats should also find riding in the car a likeable experience.

Most cats only get to go on car rides for one reason, and most of them hate it – going to the vet. This makes them associate car riding with an unpleasant experience which triggers anxiety.

To stir your cat’s opinion about the car to the favourable side, allow the furry one to explore and imprint a scent on the vehicle’s interior. Then take your feline friend for short rides. Once you get home, give your cat a treat as a reward.

### 2. Make sure you’ve got a good carrier

There’s a handful of carriers for cats you can buy online. But to get the best one for your cat, consider the size and sturdiness. Carriers for when travelling long distances with cats should be 1 ½ their size and made of a rigid casing.

Soft carriers are still an option, but remember that they may be more challenging to clean. Plus, the material could be easily torn apart if your cat or kitten is scratchy.

### 3. Train your cat to stay in a carrier

Carrier training is necessary for driving long distances with a cat, as you can’t let your pet roam freely around the car.

For one, you might end up with pee stains all over your car seats. Then there’s the chance of cat motion sickness, which includes vomiting, diarrhoea, excessive vocalisation, drooling, and restlessness.

The best way to start with carrier training is to place treats on a towel or blanket. After a few days, put the carrier nearby. Gradually move the towel closer to the carrier.

If your cat goes near the towel for the treat without seeing the carrier as a threat, you can have it inside the case. Do this repeatedly until your cat starts to voluntarily get into the carrier.

### 4. Keep the carrier extra cosy and pee-proof

Put a blanket inside the carrier to make it more comfortable for your feline buddy. Please choose the one your cat is familiar with or has been laced by their scent. You can also spray Feliway, a cat-calming pheromone, to make it extra cosy.

Although cats can go without urinating for hours, it’s best to be prepared just in case. Add a pee pad to the carrier to ensure the urine won’t spread and for quick cleaning.

### 5. Get a cat travel litter box

Cat travel litter boxes are handier as they can be foldable or collapsible. Choose one that is waterproof, easy to clean, and big enough for your cat to fit conveniently. You won’t need a litter box for short travels, but they are beneficial for lengthy trips as you can’t just let your cat potty anywhere.

### 6. Prepare a separate bag for your cat

Your cat will need their own bag for essentials like food, treats, blankets, foldable bedding, toys, etc. If the vet prescribes a medication, don’t forget to bring that too. Plus, you have to secure documents such as a health certificate. All these items can be organised and efficiently sorted out when put in a designated cat bag.

### 7. Check with your vet first before the car travel

Even if your cat has been well-trained to get into the carrier and the car, you must rethink the long-distance travel if your vet recommends putting it on hold. Before hitting the road, ensure your cat is not suffering from any ailment.

A sick cat travelling in a car has a higher likelihood of experiencing motion sickness, which could worsen its condition. Reconsider your trip if your cat has missed critical vaccines such as anti-rabies, feline calicivirus, distemper, and viral rhinotracheitis vaccinations.

## During travel

Once you have set up everything in the carrier and have all essential cat travel items in place, you can now confidently begin your trip. However, you still need to watch out for signs of cat motion sickness and ensure your cat gets less stressed while driving.

### 1. Help your cat feel more relaxed

You can tell if your cat is anxious while on the road by how they behave. You will hear lots of meowing and sense restlessness from their carrier. In some cases, they may even make excessive amounts of drool or vomit.

But you can help your cat feel more relaxed. Start off by spraying the carrier with a cat-calming carrier like Feliway. Then play familiar music in the background. Avoid overspeeding to not startle your cat, and watch for sharp curves.

You can also play with your cat before the trip to help eliminate any excess energy. In this way, your cat can easily drift off to sleep during travel.

With the recommendation from your vet, use anti-anxiety medications for cats. Do this, especially if your feline friend has a history of aggravated stress.

### 2. Make stops every three hours

Stopping at the right time is essential for car travel with a cat. However, stopping over too often can stir anxiety in your cats as they pick up new scents, sounds, and sights. But doing it less can also aggravate motion sickness.

The sweet spot for long-distance travel, as far as stopping goes, is every three hours. You should give your cat treats and water to keep them hydrated during this time.

Of course, do bathroom breaks yourself. If you have a companion, take turns getting out of the car. But if you’re alone, plan a system to handle your breaks without leaving your cat alone. For example, if you’re stopping to eat, research ahead which restaurants are pet-friendly.

### 3. Provide treats on the road

There is a wide variety of calm cat treats available in many pet stores. Get some for when you go on a road trip with your cat, as these could help ease anxiety. For the best ones, ask your vet for recommendations. Then, make sure you give some to your cat on the road, especially when signs of stress appear.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can cats get used to long car rides?

Most cats don’t travel a lot. But those who do can get through long car rides and even enjoy them. If cats are adequately trained and conditioned for trips, it’s not impossible for them to love the experience. On the other hand, if your cat is not used to even the shortest ride, it could develop cat motion sickness when taken on a long road trip.

### How long can a cat travel without a litter box?

It is believed that cats can go up to 48 hours without using their kitty litter box, even if they have eaten full meals and drank water on a schedule. This could remain true even during a 12-hour car ride with your cat. Nevertheless, the safest amount of time to travel without a litter box is between six and eight hours at most.

### Should I cover my cat’s carrier when travelling?

If you are taking your cat for a car ride, covering its carrier with a blanket or towel is a good idea. When cats feel stressed or anxious, their natural instinct is to hide. This is why a carrier cover can provide a sense of security and lessen the chances of your cat developing motion sickness.

## Takeaway

To go on car travel with a cat means doing extra prep to ensure your feline friend is comfortable and stress-free. Make the most of your road trip by following the tips above. Get your cat in the car as often as possible if you want to condition them for multiple trips.
