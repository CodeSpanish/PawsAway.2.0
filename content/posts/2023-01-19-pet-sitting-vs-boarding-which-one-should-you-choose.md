# Pet Sitting Vs Boarding: Which One Should You Choose?

Leaving your pet behind for a few days is not easy – emotionally and logistically. The only way to get peace of mind is to leave your fur baby in capable hands. That said, you have two options: hire a pet sitter or have your pet boarded. But your choice depends on how pet sitting vs boarding compares and which option matches your needs.

**Pet sitting is hiring someone to watch over your pet in their home or at yours. In comparison, pet boarding involves bringing your pet to a boarding facility, like a kennel or cattery, for temporary housing.**

Please keep reading to know more about pet boarding vs pet sitting, its pros and cons, and things you need to consider.

## Difference between pet boarding and pet sitting

When pitting pet sitting vs boarding, the primary difference between the two is the arrangement. Of course, you can choose either way when it comes to pet care services, but one can be more suitable than the other in some instances.

For example, pet boarding is ideal for those who wish to leave their pets in a secure facility for an extended time. On the other hand, pet sitting is more suited for fur parents looking for someone trustworthy to look after their pets overnight or during the day.

## Pet boarding: pros and cons

Boarding pet facilities can be a suitable choice for owners looking for a safe, convenient way to take care of their pets while away.

Kennels and catteries are handled by trained professionals, with modern ones operating similarly to a hotel – prioritising your pet’s comfort and wellness. But however remarkable as pet boarding sounds, it may not be the best option for pet owners on a budget.

Read on to find out more about the advantages and disadvantages of pet boarding and deciding factors to consider.

### Pros

#### Pets are kept in a secure environment

Pet boarding facilities have areas prepared to cater to your pet’s needs, size, and safety. They are also supervised around the clock. Plus, the care providers ensure they are fed, get exercise, and given prescribed medication if necessary.

#### Interaction with other pets

Suppose you have a highly sociable pet, like a Golden Retriever. In that case, they will likely love playing with other dogs – and they’ll have this opportunity in a pet boarding facility. Kennels usually allow dogs to play with one another, provided they don’t pose a threat.

You won’t have to worry about strangers visiting you
The primary concern about pet sitting is opening your home to a stranger, which comes with several risks. Obviously, you don’t have to worry about this in a pet boarding facility, as you’ll simply transport your fur baby to the kennel, cattery, or pet hotel.

### Cons

#### It can be expensive

Depending on the facility and the amenities it includes, you may see higher costs for pet boarding than hiring a pet sitter. This is because you’ll pay extra for the housing on top of the pet care services.

#### Your pet may become anxious

Pets who have experienced trauma or those not trained for boarding may experience stress the first time they are left in a kennel or cattery. For example, dogs with separation anxiety may find it stressful to be away from their owner and be taken to an unfamiliar place.

Still, you can help your dogs lessen boarding anxiety through proper planning. But if it worsens, it’s time to consider a pet sitter and consult your vet.

## Pet sitting: pros and cons

Pet owners typically hire pet-sitting services when leaving their pets for just a few hours or for daycare. However, you can also take advantage of the level of relationship you have established with a good sitter to leave your dog for a longer time.

If the sitter and your pet have bonded, it’s easier to leave your pet to a sitter than leave it in a facility when you’re going out of town. Check out the pros and cons of hiring a sitter.

### Pros

#### All the attention goes to your pet

With a sitter, your pet receives undivided attention and care that you won’t get from a kennel or cattery, where many pets get boarded. But, of course, this also depends on your arrangement with the sitter.

For instance, some pet-sitting services offer dedicated care, while others cater to multiple pets. Nonetheless, if the pet sitter is professional and trustworthy, you can be at ease.

#### Less anxiety for your pet

Pets like dogs can get anxious when boarded or leaving their familiar territory, aka your house. This should be a critical factor when weighing dog boarding vs dog sitting. You can hire a pet sitter to stay with your dogs at home if they are not yet used to going to the kennel.

#### Your pet’s routine won’t get disrupted

Even when you aren’t around for a while, your pet can continue its routine when you have someone looking after them. And the more they stick to their usual routine, the less likely they will develop separation anxiety.

#### Pet sitting fees can be negotiated

Unlike boarding facilities, where fees are usually fixed, you can negotiate service payment with a sitter. Plus, when you go to an online site for pet care providers, you can also consider a sitter based on their pricing.

**Pro Tip:** Platforms like Pawshake, Rover and DogVacay are dedicated to connecting pet owners with capable sitters. You can check their profiles, see reviews from previous clients, and enjoy other perks, such as streamlined payment and veterinary coverage under Pawshake Guarantee.

### Cons

#### Finding a sitter you can trust can be difficult

Hiring a sitter for your pet is a big decision, especially if you’re going away for a long time.

To begin with, you should ensure the person you choose to take care of your pet has the requisite expertise. After all, the pet sitter will not simply follow a routine but also ensure your pet’s safety. Also, you want to take precautions before inviting a stranger into your home.

#### Strict pet training may be necessary

Before booking a pet care service or initiating a meet and greet, you’ll have to ensure that your pet is also prepared for the arrangement.

For example, if you have a dog, you must secure health records, tame aggression, and impose a routine to avoid trouble with the sitter.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can house sitters also double as pet sitters?

Pet care is not something all house sitters are qualified to do or even interested in doing. Hence, it’s not recommended to assign the responsibility of caring for your pet to people whose primary job is to look after your house while you’re away. Therefore, when deciding between dog boarding and house sitting, boarding your dog is a better option since professionals will take care of your pet.

Of course, if your house sitter also works as a pet sitter, that’s the time you can book for the service. However, you’ll have to set a careful screening process to verify this.

### Are dogs happy when boarded?

Boarding can be stressful for dogs, depending on several factors, such as previous trauma, discomfort with the enclosure, etc. But some dogs may get excited to stay in a new environment. But, on the other hand, others may feel anxious at the get-go.

Also, your dog may start to miss you if they are boarded for a long time. That said, it’s crucial to help your dog cope with anxiety before kenneling or boarding.

### Is it better to leave your cat at home or on board?

Hiring a catsitter is usually better than boarding your cat in a facility or cattery. Cats are highly independent and can even be left home alone overnight. When they are at home, they are more comfortable since it is familiar, and all they need, including food, water, toys, etc., are accessible.

### Do dogs change after boarding?

You might observe some changes in your dog after boarding. When taken home from a kennel or boarding facility, a dog may readjust again, especially if it is new to the house. Depending on how long they’ve been with you, your dog may get overexcited seeing you after boarding. However, if your dog exhibits behavioural changes indicating fear and anxiety, speak with the kennel owner.

## Takeaway: Pet Sitting vs Boarding

The difference between pet boarding and pet sitting can be explained more easily when looking at the two options side by side, as it provides a greater understanding of which one to choose when leaving your pets for some time. While both choices are perfectly viable, consider other factors involving your pet, such as their tendency to experience separation anxiety, age, overall personality, and so on.
